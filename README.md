How to fill a perfect draft keg with home brew

How to Fill the keg
1) connect the pipe to air in on the vacuum pump box
2) Connect the liquid connector to the top of the keg and put the pipe into a container of 6 litres of water 
3) Turn on the pump this will cause the water to be pulled in to the Keg (cleaning cycle)

How to empty the keg
1) connect the pipe to the air out on the vacuum pump box
2) switch on the pump until all the liquid is discharged 

Repeat the above process with a no rinse sanitiser 

How to fill the keg with un pressurised beer
1) add 6 litres of beer to a sanitised bucket 
2) add the required amount of sugar to ferment to the correct C02 level for your beer style.
3) Fill the keg with the beer 
4) Condition the keg for two weeks so that it is at the correct C02 level

How to fill the keg with pressurised beer (from a fermentor?)
1) Connect the liquid connector to the top of the keg and put the pipe to fermenter/corny keg.
3) connect a spunding valve to the air (in/out) pipe.
3) As the beer in the fermenter/corny keg pressurised the beer should transfer to the perfect draft keg (adjust the spunding valve to help the transfer)
